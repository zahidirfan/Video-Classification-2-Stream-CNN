# Video Classification using Two Stream CNNs

We use a spatial and a temporal stream with VGG-16 and CNN-M respectively for modeling video information.
LSTMs are stacked on top of the CNNs for modeling long term dependencies between video frames.
For more information, see these papers:

Here are the steps to run the project on CCV dataset:

## Creating a virtual environment

First create a directory named env and then run the following inside the directory. This will create a virtual environment. Assuming we create a requirements.txt file to help install modules that are needed in the project.

`$ mkdir env`

`$ cd env`

`$ virtualenv venv-video-classification `

`$ source  env-video-classification\bin\activate`

`$ cd ..`

`$ pip install requirements.txt` 


## Setting up the DataSet
1. Get the YouTube data, remove broken videos and negative instances and finally create a pickle file of the dataset by running scripts from the utility_scripts folder


2. Temporal Stream (in the temporal folder):
  1. Run temporal_vid2img to create optical flow frames and the related files
  2. Run temporal_stream_cnn to start with the temporal stream training


3. Spatial Stream (in the spatial folder):
  1. Run the spatial_vid2img to create static frames and related files
  2. Download the vgg16_weights.h5 file from [here](https://gist.github.com/baraldilorenzo/07d7802847aaad0a35d3) and put it in the spatial folder

  3. Run spatial_stream_cnn to start with the spatial stream training

4. Temporal Stream LSTM: 
Will soon update the code

5. Spatial Stream LSTM: 
Will soon update the code
